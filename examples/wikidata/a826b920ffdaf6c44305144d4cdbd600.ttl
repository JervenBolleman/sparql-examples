#The MEDASSESS, MEDDATE and MEDREV jargon refers to section shortcuts on the MEDRS page
#at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)
#i.e WP:MEDASSESS and so on.

#This is a minimalist working version of a MEDRS algorithm
#that does enough to show where the edge case whitelists and blacklists
#can be placed in a SPARQL query. 
#Those lists are only present in placeholder form with realistic data, but the
#VALUES statements can be scaled up into longer lists.

#The DOAJ requirement means no \"predatory\" journals would
#appear, with a caveat entered about start time of DOAJ status.

#The case analysis can incorporate more than two cases, by using a multiple UNION.
